**Code and Website Purpose:**
Our code is designed to be a user friendly website that will be used to sign out collaboration rooms in PHS, as well as other rooms. It will reserve rooms and show what days and times a room is available. 

**User Guide:**
1. Firstly, open the Application/Website
2. Once done, if a student, you do not have access to book rooms, but may view them, so skip steps 3-5.
3. If a teacher, locate the login button on the top-right-hand corner of the screen, and click it to log in
4. Input your mcpsmd.net email and then click "login." This will then send an email to the account that you put in.
5. Navigate to your email, and find the confirmation email sent by "smcs2026.swab@gmail.com" which will then redirect you back to the website but logged in
6. To check the rooms available, look at the bottom half of the screen, in which you will see the rooms available to be booked and checked out (i.e. SMCS Hub, Global Hub, etc.). Clicking the "Check Availability" button for one of these rooms will redirect you to a page in which you can select the time that you would like to book the room.
7. To change the date locate the date selector in the middle of the screen. Click it to open an available calendar which will provide you with the date option of your choice. Click it to check the rooms for that date.
8. Once you have selected the date and room that you would like to book, once having clicked on the room you will be met with options for periods 1-8 as well as lunch. Click "Book Now" to book the room of your choice. 
9. This will now redirect you to a page where you can choose to reccuringly book the room mutliple times. Please choose how often you would like to book this room and click "never" if you would only like to book it once.
10. Click "Confirm my Booking" To confirm your booking, and this will then bring you back to the main page.
11. You have now successfully booked a room. You can not repeat this process to book as many rooms as you need, skipping steps 1-5.
